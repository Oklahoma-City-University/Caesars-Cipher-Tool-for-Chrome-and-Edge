# Caesars-Cipher-Tool-for-Chrome-Edge-Browsers
In this chromium browser project I will implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string as plaintext and the shift (key) factor and then outputs the modified string as ciphertext.



Tasklist

- [x] On paper, I will use a shift cipher to encrypt and decrypt a short message to get a feel for how this cipher works.
- [x] Highlight how I will use conditionals and flow controls to convert a string into a number.
- [x] Brush up my knowledge on how I will implement my knowledge of strings, arrays, and hashes for encrypting and decrypting messages.
- [x] Develop an algorithm for this procedure that works for input text and shift value.
- [x] Create and initialize (set to blank) three variables to store inputText, shiftValue, and outputText.
- [x] Ask the user to enter a plaintext message to be encoded. 
- [x] Set the inputText variable to the answer from the user.
- [x] Ask the user to enter a shift value for the shift cipher. If their answer is a number; Set the shiftValue variable to their answer.
- [x] Ask the user if they wish to encode or decode.
- [x] Then call a custom procedure to encrypt or decrypt the data. 
- [x] Check that my code works as expected.
- [x] Ensure my code wraps from z to a and keeps the same case.
- [x] Adding the Brute Force Mode to my code 
- [x] Package my code as a chrome extension
- [x] Create and add a Manifest.json file to my code
- [x] Use a google developer account to upload my project to the Chrome extension store - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-chrome-extension/ 
- [x] Publish my project to the chrome web store for other cybersecurity enthusiasts to test, use and play with  - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/register/ 
- [x] Publish my project to the Resource Group  (CaesarsCipher-S01-Jake) i created on OKCU Azure portal fore students (the free tier subscription for students) for other cybersecurity enthusiasts to test, use and play with...it is currently publicly accessible at https://gray-forest-042c17010.3.azurestaticapps.net. 


Wish me luck in my presentation tommorrow!
